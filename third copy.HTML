<p>It is mid 2004. World has left behind the DOTCOM bust, 9/11 
tragedy, the economic downturn, etc. and moved on. Countless 
Indians have relentlessly worked for close to two decades to 
successfully establish “India” as a software brand. At times I take 
secret pleasure in seeing that a book that I have been part of, has 
contributed in its own little way in shaping so many budding 
careers that have made the “India” brand acceptable.</p>
